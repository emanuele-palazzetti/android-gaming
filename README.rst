Android gaming
==============

This is a sample project used to study "Google game services". It is based on Google sample_ games

.. _sample: https://github.com/playgameservices/android-samples

Configuration
-------------

Just clone this repository and be sure to change ``me.palazzetti`` namespace so it matches yours.
After that, just configure your Google Play Game Services.

Google Play Game Services
-------------------------

Inside ``res/values/ids.xml`` you can configure your application id, all your achievements
and leaderboards tokens. Go to your `Developer console`_ and link your app to create OAuth2 client
so you can add all achievements and leaderboards according to this game (*see above file*).

.. _Developer Console: https://play.google.com/apps/publish/

The vision
----------

Make this project a valid playground for everyone who want to start developing Android games.
